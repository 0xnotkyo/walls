## 🌿 About  

My personal collection of wallpapers, carefully curated for their style and aesthetics.

All these wallpapers come from different sources like **Unixporn, Wallhaven, Reddit and Github.**
This repo is constantly growing, with new wallpapers added frequently

>  📌 If you are the author or creator of any of these images, feel free to contact me and I’ll give you credit.

## 🌐 Web App  

The collection also includes a **web version** with a more visual and aesthethic interface to easily explore all the wallpapers.
